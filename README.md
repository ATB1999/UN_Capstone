# UN_Capstone
Capstone Project which develops a Conflict regression model at a sub-national scale in Africa for conflict prediction and explainability of underlying factors.

The main dataset from which everything is derived is Afrogrid, at the forefront of conflict research which includes for grids og 60x60 km information about sub-regions in Africa from multiple variables and studies of reference (Priogrid, SCAD...). You can find the latest version in the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LDI5TK). Above you can visualize many of the papers that my team used to inform our approach, as well as the final written report associated to the project.

Lastly, you can also visualize QGIS visualizations for Central African Republic for a month. I was not in charge of that part of the project, but it was illustrative enough to get to know how this geospatial software can help in issues like these.
